    /*Which one of the following statements makes use of a factory method?
    A) Locale locale1 = new Locale("it", "", "");
    B) NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.GERMANY);
    C) Locale locale3 = new Locale.Builder().setLanguageTag("it").build();
    D) Date today = new Date();
    E) Locale locale4 = Locale.ITALIAN;

    Answer: B) NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.GERMANY);

(A factory method creates an instance and returns back. Using a constructor directly to create an object is not
    related to a factory method, so A) and D) are not correct. C) builds a locale and is perhaps an example for the
    Builder pattern. E) merely accesses the predefined Locale object; so itâ€™s not a method.)*/
