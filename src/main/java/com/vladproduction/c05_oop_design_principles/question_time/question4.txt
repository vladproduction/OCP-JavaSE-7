Consider the following three classes: University, Department, and CSE_Department (CSE
stands for Computer Science and Engineering). The University and Department
classes are related with relation R1, and the Department and CSE_Department classes are
related with relation R2. Which combination of these relations is appropriate?
A. R1: inheritance, R2: inheritance
B. R1: composition, R2: inheritance
C. R1: inheritance, R2: composition
D. R1: composition, R2: composition
Answer: B

B. R1: composition, R2: inheritance
(basically we can say: University 'has-a' Department, and CSE_Department 'is-a' Department)

(A university has many departments, so they share a has-a relationship between them, a composition relationship.
CSE_Department is a department, so these two share a is-a relationship between them, an inheritance
relationship.)
