This approach allows you to model the shared characteristics of files and folders through a common superclass (FolderItem).
Both File and Folder can inherit from this superclass, allowing polymorphism.
In this case, a folder can contain both files and other folders recursively, effectively modeling a file system.
This is a classic application of the Composite Design Pattern, which is suitable for hierarchical structures.

Choice C is indeed the best answer. By employing inheritance with a common superclass (FolderItem) and utilizing composition
to allow folders to contain both files and other folders, you create a flexible and clear model of a file system.
