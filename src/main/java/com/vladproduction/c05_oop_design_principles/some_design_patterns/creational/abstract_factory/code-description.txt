 Two major features to grasp:

1)Product hierarchy:
-Shape is the base interface extended by  DisplayFriendlyShape and PrinterFriendlyShape;
-Two flavors of the Circle and Rectangle classes are defined for each: display-friendly and printer-friendly shape;

2)Abstract factory implementation:
-Made up of ShapeFactory as the base interface;
-PrinterFriendlyFactory and DisplayFriendlyFactory as the concrete factories;
-PrinterFriendlyFactory creates only PrinterFriendlyCircle and PrinterFriendlyRectangle;
-similarly, DisplayFriendlyFactory creates DisplayFriendlyCircle and DisplayFriendlyRectangle;
