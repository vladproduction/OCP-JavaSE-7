Network Communication:
The server and client communicate using socket programming, demonstrating how objects can be transmitted over a network

/**
 * Below is an illustrative example that demonstrates how a serialized object can be sent over a network
 * and deserialized on another machine.
 * This example will use Java's built-in server and client sockets to communicate the serialized data.
 * */

Usage:
1)Run the Server code in one terminal or IDE instance.
2)Run the Client code in another terminal or IDE instance.
3)The client will send a Person object to the server, and the server will print the introduction message,
  which demonstrates that the object was not only transmitted but also functional upon deserialization.

If you try to run the server without the Person class available (for instance, if it was removed from the classpath),
the server would successfully read the state of the Person object but would not be able to invoke methods such as introduce(),
showcasing the point you mentioned.

Note:
Make sure that both the server and client classes are compiled in the same directory or appropriately configured classpath
to recognize the Person class.
This is essential for the entire serialization and deserialization process to function correctly
across different machines or environments.
