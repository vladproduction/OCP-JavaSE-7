/*The wait(int) method (with or without timeout value) should be called only after acquiring a lock: a wait() call
adds the thread to the waiting queue of the acquired lock. If you donâ€™t do that, there is no proper transition from the
running state to timed_waiting (or waiting state, if a timeout value is not given) to happen. So, the program crashes by
throwing an IllegalMonitorStateException exception.*/
