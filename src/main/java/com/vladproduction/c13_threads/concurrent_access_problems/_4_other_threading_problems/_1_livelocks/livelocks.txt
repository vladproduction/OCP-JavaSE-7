    Livelock:
A livelock occurs when two or more threads are continuously changing states in response to each other but
are unable to make any progress;
they're too busy responding to each otherâ€™s actions rather than continuing their assigned tasks.

    Difference from Deadlocks:
* Deadlock: In this situation, two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources,
causing the program to halt entirely without progress.
* Livelock: The threads are actively changing states (e.g., reversing their movements like the cars) but still can't proceed,
leading to active yet unproductive behavior.

    How to Handle Livelocks
* Randomized Back-off:
Introduce randomness into the decision-making process. For example, if two threads are trying to acquire a resource,
they could wait for a random amount of time before trying again. This helps reduce the chances of threads continually interfering with one another.

* Priority and Quotas:
Implement a priority system where one thread gets more chances to execute before the other attempts.
This can help ensure one thread is able to complete its task.

* State Management:
Keep track of the state of threads and introduce a mechanism to detect potential livelock situations.
It might involve changing how threads respond to resource availability.

* Timeouts:
Setting a maximum time for threads to attempt to proceed can help escape scenarios of livelock.
If they exceed this time, they can reset their state and try again.

* Deciding on Actions:
Encourage threads to take a definitive action rather than waiting passively.
For instance, rather than reversing indefinitely, they could yield controls at intervals.
