Problem Statement:
Assume that you need to implement a dice player game. This is a two player
game (say the players are “Joe” and “Jane”) where the players throw the dice on their turns. When
one player throws the dice, another player waits. Once the player completes throwing, he/she
informs the other player to play; after that, he/she starts waiting for the other player to throw the
dice. You need to implement these two players as two threads working together. The game ends after
each player throws 6 times (so there will be a total of 12 throws in the game).

Approach:
Since the problem statement says “implement these two players as two threads working together,” your solution
is a multi-threaded program with each player implemented as a thread. The problem also states that when one player
throws the dice, another waits. So, you should perhaps use a wait/notify mechanism. The dice rolling should result in
a random value, so you can use the Random class for creating random numbers from 1 to 6.
