If you want a mechanism to wait for a particular event to occur, a wait/notify mechanism is the best
choice. Sometimes programmers solve this problem by using a sleep call, and they repeatedly check
the condition to see if the event has occurred. This is an ineffective solution. Further, calling sleep does
not release the lock (unlike wait), so a solution using sleep is prone to deadlocks. Do not use the sleep
method when a wait/notify mechanism is the appropriate solution.
