    /*Factorial class that implements Callable. Since the task is to compute the
    factorial of a number N, the task needs to return a result. You use Long type for the factorial value, so you implement
    Callable<Long>. Inside the Factorial class, you define the call() method that actually performs the task (the task
    here is to compute the factorial of the given number). If the given value N is negative or zero, you donâ€™t perform the
    task and throw an exception to the caller. Otherwise, you loop from 1 to N and find the factorial value*/
