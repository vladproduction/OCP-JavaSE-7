    ArrayBlockingQueue:
An ArrayBlockingQueue in Java is a thread-safe bounded blocking queue backed by an array. It can be useful in scenarios
where you want to implement producer-consumer patterns.

    This example demonstrates two threads:
1 - producer, that generates integers and adds them to the queue;
2 - consumer that takes those integers from the queue and processes them;

    Points:
* producer is produce faster elements than consumer taking from queue;
* The ArrayBlockingQueue automatically handles synchronization, avoiding the need for explicit locks;
* The blocking feature helps manage the flow of data between producers and consumers meaningfully;
* This pattern can be scaled or modified for different types of production and consumption logic;
* method Thread.currentThread().interrupt() is used in the producer and consumer classes to handle thread interruption properly;
