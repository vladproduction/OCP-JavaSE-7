Consider the following code snippet:
Path wordpadPath = Paths.get("C:\\Program Files\\Windows NT\\Accessories\\wordpad.exe");
System.out.println(wordpadPath.subpath(beginIndex, endIndex));
What are the values of the integer values beginIndex and endIndex in this program that will result in this code
segment printing the string “Program Files” as output?
a) beginIndex = 1 and endIndex = 2
+++b) beginIndex = 0 and endIndex = 1
c) beginIndex = 1 and endIndex = 1
d) beginIndex = 4 and endIndex = 16

By default, assertions are disabled. If -ea (or the -enableassertions option to enable assertions), then
the program would have printed “Error” since the exception thrown in the case of assertion failure is
java.lang.AssertionError, which is derived from the Error class.
