The main aim of this question: correctly interpret the behavior of the sleep() method in relation to thread locking and synchronization in Java.

Which of the following two statements are true regarding the sleep() method defined in Thread class?
+++a) The sleep() method takes milliseconds as an argument for the time to sleep.
b) The sleep() method takes microseconds as an argument for the time to sleep.
c) The sleep() method relinquishes the lock when the thread goes to sleep and reacquires the lock when the thread wakes up.
+++d) The sleep() method can throw InterruptedException if it is interrupted by another thread when it sleeps.

//description:
c) False: The sleep() method does not relinquish any locks held by the thread.
The sleep() method causes the thread to pause for a specified duration but does not release any synchronization locks
that the thread holds. This means if a thread is inside a synchronized block, it will still hold the lock on that block even while it is sleeping.
So, c) is not true;

d) is True because:
If a thread is sleeping, and it is interrupted by another thread, the sleep() method throws an InterruptedException.
When a thread is sleeping, it does not give up its locks; thus, any code that tries to access the synchronized section
locked by this thread will be blocked until the thread wakes up and either finishes executing or leaves the synchronized block.

In conclusion:
If a thread is sleeping and is interrupted by another thread, the sleep() method will throw an InterruptedException.
Meanwhile, the sleeping thread maintains its locks, preventing other threads from entering any synchronized section
until the sleeping thread either wakes up or finishes execution.
However, that InterruptedException is thrown because another thread is attempting to interrupt the sleeping thread
due to synchronized section access; rather, it is thrown because that other thread indeed called the interrupt() method.
