Assume that youâ€™ve the following resource bundles in your classpath:

ResourceBundle.properties
ResourceBundle_ar.properties
ResourceBundle_en.properties
ResourceBundle_it.properties
ResourceBundle_it_IT_Rome.properties

Also assume that the default locale is English (US), where the language code is en and country code is US.
Which one of these five bundles will be loaded for the call loadResourceBundle("ResourceBundle", new Locale("fr", "CA", ""));?

a) ResourceBundle.properties
b) ResourceBundle_ar.properties
+++c) ResourceBundle_en.properties
d) ResourceBundle_it.properties
e) ResourceBundle_it_IT_Rome.properties

Resource Bundle Resolution Strategy:


c) ResourceBundle_en.properties
Java looks for candidate locales for a base bundle named ResourceBundle and locale French (Canada), and
checks for the presence of the following property files:
ResourceBundle_fr_CA.properties
ResourceBundle_fr.properties
Since both of them are not there, Java searches for candidate locales for the base bundle named
ResourceBundle and a default locale (English - United States):
ResourceBundle_en_US.properties
ResourceBundle_en.properties
Java finds that there is a matching resource bundle, ResourceBundle_en.properties. Hence it loads this
resource bundle.
