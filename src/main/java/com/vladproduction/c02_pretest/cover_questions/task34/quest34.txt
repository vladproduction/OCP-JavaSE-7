Which of the following two statements are true regarding Statement and its derived types?
a) Objects of type Statement can handle IN, OUT, and INOUT parameters.
b) PreparedStatement is used for executing stored procedures.
+++c) You can get an instance of PreparedStatement by calling preparedStatement() method in the Connection
 interface.
+++d) CallableStatement extends the PreparedStatement class; PreparedStatement in turn extends the Statement
 class.
+++e) The interface Statement and its derived interfaces implement the AutoCloseable interface, hence it can be used
 with try-with-resources statement.

 Statement Analysis:
 a) Objects of type Statement can handle IN, OUT, and INOUT parameters.
        False: The Statement interface cannot handle parameters directly.
        Only CallableStatement can handle IN, OUT, and INOUT parameters, which are specifically for calling stored procedures.

 b) PreparedStatement is used for executing stored procedures.
        False: While PreparedStatement can be used for executing parameterized SQL queries, it is not specifically designed for
        executing stored procedures. For stored procedures, you would typically use a CallableStatement.

 c) You can get an instance of PreparedStatement by calling preparedStatement() method in the Connection interface.
        True: You get a PreparedStatement instance using the method prepareStatement(String sql) from the Connection interface.

 d) CallableStatement extends the PreparedStatement class; PreparedStatement in turn extends the Statement class.
        True: CallableStatement does indeed extend PreparedStatement, and PreparedStatement extends Statement.
        The hierarchy is as follows: Statement -> PreparedStatement -> CallableStatement.

 e) The interface Statement and its derived interfaces implement the AutoCloseable interface, hence it can be used with try-with-resources statement.
        True: The Statement interface and its derived interfaces (PreparedStatement and CallableStatement)
        do implement the AutoCloseable interface, which allows them to be used in a try-with-resources statement.

 Summary of Correct Statements (true statements are):
 c) You can get an instance of PreparedStatement by calling prepareStatement() method in the Connection interface.
 d) CallableStatement extends the PreparedStatement class; PreparedStatement in turn extends the Statement class.
 e) The interface Statement and its derived interfaces implement the AutoCloseable interface, hence it can be used with try-with-resources statement.
