5. Consider this program and choose the best option describing its behavior (assume that
the connection is valid):
try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
 ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM contact")){
 System.out.println(resultSet.getInt("id") + "\t"
 + resultSet.getString("firstName") + "\t"
 + resultSet.getString("lastName") + "\t"
 + resultSet.getString("email") + "\t"
 + resultSet.getString("phoneNo"));
}
catch (SQLException sqle) {
 System.out.println("SQLException");
}
A. This program will print the following: SQLException.
B. This program will print the first row from contact.
C. This program will print all the rows from contact.
D. This program will report compiler errors.

Answer: A. This program will print the following: SQLException.
(The statement while (resultSet.next()) is missing.)
