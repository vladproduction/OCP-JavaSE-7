4. Which one of the following statements would be needed in JDBC 3.0?
A. Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://
localhost:3306/addressBook", "root", "password"))
B. Connection connection = DriverManager.createConnection("jdbc:mysql://
localhost:3306/addressBook", "root", "password"))
C. Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver").newInstance();
D. Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver").getInstance();

Answer: C. Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver").newInstance();
(You need to explicitly load the JDBC driver using the Class.forName() statement in JDBC 3.0. From 4.0
onwards, this statement is not needed and you can directly get the connection. Note that option A) shows how to
get the connection for MySQL, and this URl will depend on the specific database used.)
