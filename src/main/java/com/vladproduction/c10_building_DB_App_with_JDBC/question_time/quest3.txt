3. Consider the following sequence of operations in a transaction:

// assume that all operations execute in this program successfully without
// throwing any exceptions; also assume that the connection is established
// successfully
connection.setAutoCommit(false);
// insert a row into the table here
// create a savepoint in this transaction here

//insert another row into the table here
//create a named savepoint in this transaction here
//insert the third row into the table here
connection.rollback();
connection.commit();

What will be the effect of this sequence of actions after executing the statement connection.commit()?
A. Three rows will be inserted into the table.
B. No rows will be inserted into the table.
C. One row will be inserted into the table.
D. Two rows will be inserted into the table.
E. All three rows will be inserted into the table.

Answer: B. No rows will be inserted into the table.
(Since connection.rollback(); is called before connection.commit(), all operations will be undone and no
rows will be inserted into the table.)
