Summary

Working with the Path Class
•	 A Path object is a programming abstraction to represent a path of a file/directory.
•	 You can get an instance of Path using the get() method of the Paths class.
•	 Path provides two methods to use to compare Path objects: equals() and compareTo(). Even
     if two Path objects point to the same file/directory, it is not guaranteed that you will get true
     from the equals() method.

Performing Operations on Files/Directories
•	 You can check the existence of a file using the exists() method of the Files class.
•	 The Files class provides the methods isReadable(), isWriteable(), and isExecutable()
     to check the ability of the program to read, write, or execute programmatically.
•	 You can retrieve attributes of a file using the getAttributes() method.
•	 You can use the readAttributes() method of the Files class to read attributes of a file
     in bulk.
•	 The method copy() can be used to copy a file from one location to another. Similarly, the
     method move() can be used to move a file from one location to another.
•	 While copying, all the directories (except the last one if you are copying a directory) in the
     specified path must exist to avoid NoSuchFileException.
•	 Use the delete() method to delete a file; use the deleteIfExists() method to delete a file
     only if it exists.

Walking a File Tree
•	 The Files class provides two flavors of walkFileTree() to enable you to walk through a
     file system.
•	 The FileVisitor interface allows you to perform certain operations at certain key junctures.
•	 If you do not want to implement all four methods in the FileVisitor interface, you can simply
     extend your implementation from the SimpleFileVisitor class.

Finding a File
•	 The PathMatcher interface is useful when you want to find a file satisfying a certain pattern.
     You can specify the pattern using glob or regex.

Watching a Directory for Changes
•	 Java 7 offers a directory watch service that can notify you when the file you are working on is
     changed by some other program.
•	 You can register a Path object using a watch service along with certain event types. Whenever
     any file in the specified directory changes, an event is sent to the registered program.
